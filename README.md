# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This project was created in 2025 as my first step towards becoming a web developer. At that time, I was more focused on backend development, so the frontend might not be as polished. However, it showcases some essential features and functionalities.

## Introduction

This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development. The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other in a classic 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player game
- Interactive UI with prompts for player names and symbol selection
- Real-time updates on the game board
- Score tracking for both players
- Simple and intuitive gameplay

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
