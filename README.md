# JSProjects2023

Welcome to my web development projects! These projects were created in 2025 as my first steps towards becoming a web developer. At that time, I was more focused on backend development, so the frontend might not be as polished. However, these projects showcase some essential features and functionalities.

## Introduction

These projects mark the beginning of my journey into web development. They include a Tic Tac Toe game, a Snake and Ladder game, and a Country Guide application, each demonstrating different aspects of web development.

## Projects

### Tic Tac Toe Game

The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other in a classic 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

#### Features

- Two-player game
- Interactive UI with prompts for player names and symbol selection
- Real-time updates on the game board
- Score tracking for both players
- Simple and intuitive gameplay

### Snake and Ladder Game

The Snake and Ladder game is a classic board game where players roll a dice to move their pieces on a board. The goal is to reach the end of the board first, while avoiding snakes that send you back and using ladders to advance more quickly.

#### Features

- Two-player game
- Interactive UI with prompts for player names
- Real-time updates on the game board
- Snakes and ladders that affect player positions
- Simple and intuitive gameplay

### Country Guide

The Country Guide application provides detailed information about different countries. Users can search for a country and get information such as the capital, continent, population, currency, and languages spoken.

#### Features

- Fetches data from a public API
- Displays country flag, name, capital, continent, population, currency, and languages
- Simple and clean UI
- Real-time data fetching and display
